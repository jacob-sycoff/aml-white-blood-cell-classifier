# White Blood Cell Classifier for Aidining in AML Diagnosis
This repository contains the code for a blood cell classification algorithm for use in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) diagnosis. Deep learning is used to classify types of white blood cells in blood smear slide images to aid in AML diagnosis and research. Leukemia is a group of blood cancers that usually begin in the body's blood-forming tissues such as bone marrow and the lymphatic system. Leukemia diagnosis can be cumbersome and invasive. We have built a tool to aid in Acute Myeloid Leukemia diagnosis because it is relatively less researched and early detection can save a lot of peopleâ€™s lives. Specifically, our models identify white blood cells in single cell images with high accuracy. This aids in diagnosis as certain cell subtypes are indicative of disease.
