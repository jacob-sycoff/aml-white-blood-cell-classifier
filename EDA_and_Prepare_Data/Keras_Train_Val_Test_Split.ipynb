        "We did this by using a library called splitfolders. Splitfolders allows us to copy the images from one data path and paste them into another file path into respective train, validation, and test folders. It splits the data by class based on the folder name the images are in. Thus, each cell type has about an even 0.8,0.1,0.1 split. This libaray worked well with the file structure we had with each folder containing a certain cell class type. More on this library can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/split-folders/"
